**What is Brew Thumbs Up?**

Brew Thumbs Up is a mobile app that pairs recently released movies with a list of beer.  If you choose to watch a movie, it will give you a weaker or stronger beer based on the movie's rating.

**Why?**

This app was created for Hack Virginia, a hackathon hosted at the University of Virginia.  The primary focus was to demonstrate basic API consumption and information display on Android.

**Changes**

Maybe we'll make this app a real app.  Someday.
